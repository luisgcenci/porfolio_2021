I'm passionate about being challenged and solving problems through coding, and I'm ready to make a good impact in the world through my skills. I can code in java, python and javascript. I have experience with web development frameworks such as React (States, Hooks, Router) and Flask. In the front-end, I can also help with my knowledge in HTML5, CSS and jQuery. And in the back-end I could add value to your projects with my skills in NodeJS, Express, Flask, MongoDB, MySQL and SQLAlchemy. I have experineces with Cloud Computing using AWS services as well, services such as EC2, s3, Memcached, Lambda, SNS, SQS and API Gateway. I'm also currently learning React Native and I'm aiming to be part of the Mobile App Development 'World' pretty soon. I speak three languages: portugese, spanish and english and I'm SO ready to start learning some ducth. Oh, I have deployed a few apps/websites with Ngnix, Certbot and Ubuntu using Linode/Digital Ocean hosting services too. Oh I also got experience prototyping with Figma.. I honestly just love to be everywhere ðŸ’œ.",
